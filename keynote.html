  <p class="body">Dr. Woo Hyoung Lee, P.E. is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Construction Engineering at the University of Central Florida (UCF). He received his Ph.D. in environmental engineering from the University of Cincinnati in 2009. Prior to joining UCF in 2013, he worked for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Risk Management Research Laboratory as a post-doc. His primary research area is to develop renewable (bio)energy processes for environmental sustainability and his other research interest is to develop electrochemical microsensors for in situ investigation of physical and chemical dynamics in microenvironments (e.g., biofilm, corrosion, emulsions, or plant) by combining with nano and biotechnology. He has been PI on competitive grants from federal agencies (NSF, NIFA/USDA, NASA, USEPA), state agencies, local municipalities and industry. He published total 38 journal papers and 6 book chapters. He is an associate editor of the journal, Water Environment Research (WER), which is the official journal of the Water Environment Federation and very well-regarded in the wastewater field. He is currently a registered professional engineer in the U.S.</p>

 <p class="body">Jalel Azaiez is currently a Professor at the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering in the University of Calgary (Canada). He is also Associate Dean in the Faculty of Graduate Studies. He holds a Dilôme d’Ingénieur from the Ecole Centrale de Paris (France) and a M.Sc. and Ph.D. from Stanford University (U.S.A.) both in Chemical Engineering. 
His recent research focuses on modelling fluid flow instabilities and in particular those involving complex flows in porous media. These include non-isothermal flows with or without chemical reactions, involving Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with a particular focus on nanofluids in micro-geometries. His research team has developed a number of software and mathematical algorithms to analyze flow instabilities under a wide variety of conditions that have applications in the fields of oil recovery, soil remediation and materials processing. He holds a number of awards on his research and teaching accomplishments. He serves on the editorial board of three Journals and has presented invited talks and seminars in numerous worldwide forums (Belgium, France, Japan, USA, etc.).</p>
